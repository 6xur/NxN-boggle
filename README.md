# Boggle N x N (Any Size)

This is a command-line Boggle game written in Python.

Choose whether to play with 3x3 boards, 4x4 boards or more by entering a board size. Note that large board sizes take longer to load and are difficult to read.

## How to Run:

To play Boggle, simply enter:

```
python boggle.py
```

The program will display a random N x N board. Try to find all possible words on the Boggle board. Words must be at least 3 letters long and will be counted only once if repeated.

Type ```!help``` for a list of commands and ```!exit``` when you are finished.
